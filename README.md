# griffith_blog

Simple Blog with Node.js / Express / MongoDB

Go to <https://basicbloggriffith.herokuapp.com/> for online version

If you want to run local version (I mean local for website, mongoDB is always sync on prod version) :

    npm install

To have hot reload (if you want to edit something and see the thing happen)
    
    npm run dev

you need to have nodemon installed, ```npm install nodemon``` may do the job ;)

Or for having safe prod version

    npm run exec

After go to https://localhost/3000 (3000 is the default port, maybe your computer use another so check what is print on terminal)

If all it's okay you will see a beautifull blog on screen !

Hope you will be okay with all the step and if you want to know more on how to launch or anything else, don't hesitate to contact me : arnaud.ridet@student.griffith.ie

I wish you a good day, thank you for reading this ! :)
